          ● Led research in avian response to heavy mineral surface mine reclamation in southeastern Georgia
          ● Designed and implemented intensive avian monitoring surveys, using bioacoustic monitoring with autonomous recording units (ARUs)
          ● Automatically annotated acoustic data using BirdNET, integrated within high performance computing
          ● Evaluated BirdNET performance and validated BirdNET predictions to determine thresholds for filtering
          ● Assessed potentially significant habitat variables with line-intercept vegetation sampling data
          ● Conducted statistical analyses to estimate species occupancy or abundance with validated BirdNET output and determine significant environmental parameters influencing occupancy and abundance in R
          ● Analyzed the efficacy of passive acoustic monitoring to detect focal species– informing future monitoring protocols
          ● Mist netting, banding, and recapture of 30+ passerines to understand site use and body condition
          ● Utilized systematic pipeline for large volume data storage and management– involving network-attached storage systems and high performance computing
          ● Supervised and trained research technician tasked with collecting data to meet project goals
          ● Collaborated with the USGS Virginia Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit team as a peer mentor to other graduate students
          ● Presented regular updates on project data, analysis, and results to funders and collaborators, including private, state and federal institutions

        description: |
          ● Independently led data collection and outreach efforts across the Piedmont region for the North Carolina Bird Atlas (NCBA), a longitudinal project gaining insights in distribution, breeding status, and conservation needs for all avian species in North Carolina
          ● Granted access to survey private and commercial properties through various outreach methods, including cold calls and direct mailings– fostered continued working relationships with property owners with engaging communication
          ● Surveyed land parcels via Esri ArcGIS to determine property ownership and habitat characteristics
          ● Steered survey effort by monitoring the NCBA eBird database
          ● Frequently scheduled and traveled on multi-day trips across the region– gave weekly reports on travel to supervisors
          ● Designed survey routes in areas with remote access and adverse field conditions with Esri ArcMap, Field Maps, and Guru Maps
          ● Performed eBird checklist surveys (600+) including observational behavioral data in a variety of habitats
          ● Conducted point count surveys (200+) using Esri Survey123 incorporating distance-sampling methodologies
          ● Collaborated with supervisors, colleagues, and committee members in regards to achieving NCBA objectives
          ● Published website blogs and social media posts pertinent to the NCBA’s outreach goals
